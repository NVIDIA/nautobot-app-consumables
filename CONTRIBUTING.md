# Nautobot Consumables App Contribution Guidelines
Welcome to the Nautobot Consumables App project!
This document outlines the procedures and standards for contributing to the Consumables source code.
Adherence to these guidelines ensures code quality, readability, and maintainability.
We look forward to your contributions!

## Contribution Process

### Identifying the Feature or Fix

Contributors looking to add features or fixes are encouraged to reach out to the team by creating issues on the project's issue tracker.
This step ensures that efforts are not duplicated and that the proposed changes align with the project's goals.
Please communicate with the main developers before starting work to avoid the potential for your PR not being accepted.

### Development and Coding Standards

Adhering to coding standards is crucial for maintaining the quality of the codebase.
Here are the guidelines you should follow:

- **Code Formatting and Style:**
  - Follow PEP 8 standards for coding style, emphasizing readability and proper documentation.
  - Use four spaces for indentation and maintain line length under 100 characters.
  - All Python codes should have the license header.
    There should be a single blank line after the header if it is an import line.
    If there are no import statements and a class definition appears directly, there should be two blank lines.
  - There should be two blank lines between class definitions.
  - Use Google style for docstrings to ensure consistency and readability.
  - There should be no trailing spaces or blank lines at the end of files.
  - If adding documentation, each sentence in the file should be on a separate line.
    Markdown parsing and HTML rendering will collapse the spaces, and having each sentence on a separate line makes reading the diff if the file is update much easier. 

- **Branch and Commit Guidelines:**
  - Fork the repository and create branches for changes in your fork.
  - If you need to work on another branch that someone has implemented but not merged to the main branch, checkout that branch first and create a new branch on it.
    Do not copy and paste files; we lose all commit histories with this approach.
  - Commit messages should be readable and understandable.
    Avoid vague messages like "bugfix" or "feature."
    Commit messages should provide sufficient information for reviewers.
  - Aim for multiple small commits rather than a large one for easier code reviews and rebasing.

- **Linting and Testing:**
  - Ensure your code passes all linters set up in `.gitlab-ci.yml` - pylint, flake8, pydocstyle and mypy.
    Linters run automatically when you push changes to the remote repository, but you can also run them locally.

- **Signing Your Work:**
  - We require all contributors to sign off on their commits, certifying that the contribution is their original work or that they have rights to submit it under a compatible license.
    Any contribution which contains commits that are not Signed-Off will not be accepted.
  - To sign off on a commit you simply use the `--signoff` (or `-s`) option when committing your changes:
  ```bash
  $ git commit -s -m "Add cool feature."
  ```
  This will append the following to your commit message:
  ```
  Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
  ```

    Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

    By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

    (a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I have the right to submit it under the open source license indicated in the file; or

    (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source license and I have the right under that license to submit that work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part by me, under the same open source license (unless I am permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated in the file; or

    (c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified it.

    (d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution are public and that a record of the contribution (including all personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with this project or the open source license(s) involved.
  ```

### Pull Request (PR) Creation
- Create a merge request on GitHub for your changes.
  If your code has not been tested, mark the PR as a draft.
- Follow the merge request template, which includes fields for summary and test plan.
  Ensure your PR has a readable and understandable subject, avoiding generic titles like "bugfix" or "feature1."
- Use bullet points in the summary to clearly outline your contributions.
  In the test plan section, detail the experiments and commands run, attaching stdout of your command to demonstrate the effectiveness of your code and to help other contributors understand how to validate and run your code.
- Contributors are responsible for rebasing their branch if the main branch has been updated while they are working on their branch.
- Ensure that all pipeline stages pass without any error.
  In case of failure, check the pipeline stage output and update your code accordingly.

Thanks in advance for your patience as we review your contributions; we do appreciate them!
